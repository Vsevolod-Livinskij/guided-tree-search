- write a precise description of the problem being solved here

- write a collection of trivial but pathological generators, such as
  the one that calls flip() 1000 times in succession

- work out how to evaluate how well this thing works, when used in
  non-trivial situations

- plug this into Csmith and YARPGen and see what happens
